# Interactive Menu

If you run the script without any command-line arguments, it will present an interactive menu:

```bash
python autologin.py
```

This menu allows you to easily manage credentials and start the auto-login process without remembering specific commands.

## Key Options

- **Start Auto-Login**: Begins the re-authentication process.
- **Manage Credentials**: Add, edit, or delete stored credentials.
- **Show Credentials**: View all credentials currently in the database.
- **Import/Export**: Handle CSV data for bulk credential management.
- **Speed Test**: Measure your current internet connection performance.
- **Exit**: Close the application.
